Feel free to test this application.
It's entirely possible I misspelled something or used improper grammar.
It's even more likely I messed up a stat calculation.

For the "Stat Increase" radio buttons, each stat gains +5.
For the "Stat Decrease" radio buttons, each stat loses -5.

Additionally, you will get additional buffs for being a certain class.
Those buffs are as follows:

Smartass Guy:
Ego(Health): +3
Humor(Attack): -5
Inteligence(Defense): +5
Energy(Speed): 0
Wit(Stat Buff): 0

Low Jokes Guy:
Ego(Health): 0
Humor(Attack): +5
Inteligence(Defense): -5
Energy(Speed): +3
Wit(Stat Buff): 0

Witty Guy:
Ego(Health): 0
Humor(Attack): +3
Inteligence(Defense): 0
Energy(Speed): -5
Wit(Stat Buff): +5

Coffee Guy:
Ego(Health): +5
Humor(Attack): -5
Inteligence(Defense): 0
Energy(Speed): +3
Wit(Stat Buff): 0
